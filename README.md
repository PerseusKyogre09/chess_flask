# Chess Flask

## Overview
This project is focused on implementing various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to solve complex problems efficiently. The project includes a variety of features that demonstrate the use of different DSA concepts.

## Features
- **Node Traversal**: Implements depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms for traversing nodes in a graph or tree.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Includes implementations of quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort for efficient data sorting.
- **Linked Lists**: Demonstrates the use of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
- **Binary Trees**: Implements binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and red-black trees for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Includes algorithms for finding the shortest path (Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford) and detecting cycles in a graph.
- **Hashing**: Demonstrates the use of hash tables for efficient data access and collision resolution techniques like chaining and open addressing.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the setup guide.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PerseusKyogre09/chess_flask.git
cd chess_flask
```

## Running the Application
To run the Flask application, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable:
    ```sh
    export FLASK_APP=app.py
    ```

3. Run the Flask development server:
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to view the application.
